    "**In my experience, people tend to prefer Python for text processing and analysis over other programming languages like R, Ruby, Matlab, and others.**\n",
    "\n",
    "While programming languages are designed to be general purpose, there are more packages and resources for text-related tasks than practically any other language. This means that if you want to do some online data mining, work with gigantic corpora, or custom semantic tagging systems (say, for happy versus sad words), you can do all of this *and* the analysis in the same language. Take the example of data mining. You could:\n",

    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Use the <code>BeautifulSoup</code> package to scrape a list of webpages and parse them into plaintext.</li>\n",
    "    <li>With regular expressions (regex), <code>nltk</code>, and the <code>string</code> package you can clean the plaintext, tokenize it, create frequency distributions and ngram models.</li>\n",
    "    <li><code>pandas</code> is good for data analyis tasks for the statistics that come out of NLTK.</li>\n",
    "    <li>You can even train a \"deep learning\" neural network based on text data without leaving Python, thanks to <code>PyTorch</code></li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
